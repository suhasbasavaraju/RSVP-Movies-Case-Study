# Executive Summary and Reccomendations: 

In the pursuit of creating successful and impactful movies, an analysis of various movie genres, superhit movies (defined as those with an average or median rating of 8 or higher), and the associated total votes was conducted, and following recommendations are made based on the findings:

1. Genre Selection: Focus on Drama
Our analysis indicates that the Drama genre has a track record of delivering superhit movies with high ratings. Notably, in 2019, both "Avengers End Game" and "The Lion King," belonging to the Drama genre, achieved exceptional worldwide gross incomes. Therefore, it is advisable to concentrate on producing movies within the Drama genre.

2. Optimal Movie Duration: Approximately 110 Minutes
To maximize audience engagement and retention, consider restricting the duration of your movies to approximately 110 minutes. This duration strikes a balance between storytelling and viewer comfort.

3. Director Selection:
For mainstream projects, consider hiring renowned directors such as James Mangold or Anthony Rose, known for their ability to create compelling narratives.
To capture regional nuances and appeal to diverse audiences, AL Vijay is recommended as a director, as he excels in bringing regional authenticity to his work.

4. Actor Choices:
For lead roles, consider the following accomplished actors:

  a. Mammooty
  b. Mohanlal
  c. Yogi Babu
  d. Vijay Sethupathi
Selecting one among these talented actors will significantly enhance the movie's potential for success.

5. Actress Selection:
Tapsee Pannu emerges as a top choice for lead female roles due to her exceptional acting skills and versatility. Additionally, consider Parvathy or Susan Brown, who can contribute to the project's success with their talent and on-screen presence.

6. Supporting Genre Choice:
Given our earlier analysis, the Drama genre is the most promising genre to focus on, as it has consistently produced high-grossing superhit movies.

7. Production Company:
Consider the following production companies for your projects:

  a. Dream Warrior Pictures
  b. National Theatre Live
  
However, if RSVP is interested in producing multilingual movies, it is recommended to collaborate with production giants like Star Cinema or Twentieth Century Fox, as they have a proven track record of handling multilingual projects effectively.

These recommendations are based on a thorough analysis of movie genres, superhit criteria, and industry trends. By following these guidelines, RSVP can enhance its chances of producing successful and impactful movies in the highly competitive film industry.
